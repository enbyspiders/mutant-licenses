This license exists to release software that empowers individuals, collectives, worker-owned cooperatives, and nonprofits, while denying usage to those that exploit labor for profit.

(Formerly know as the No Blockchain License)

* ‚öóÔ∏è [Do No Harm License](https://github.com/raisely/NoHarm) - The Do No Harm License is for developers that agree in general with the principles of open source software, but are uncomfortable with their software being used as part of efforts to destroy lives, our environment and our future.

* üå∂Ô∏è [[HL] Hippocratic License](https://firstdonoharm.dev/) - The core license provides protections for universally recognized human rights, including specific provisions for Indigenous rights. We are also developing optional modules that focus on specific areas of concern, such as environmental justice or labor rights.

  * [[NVPL] Nonviolent Public License](https://git.pixie.town/thufie/npl-builder/src/branch/main/nvpl.md) - The Nonviolent Public License aims to ensure basic protections against forms of violence, coercion, and discrimination which creations are frequently leveraged for in the modern world.
  * [[CNPL] Cooperative Nonviolent Public License](https://git.pixie.town/thufie/npl-builder/src/branch/main/cnpl.md) - The Cooperative Nonviolent Public License and CNPL-NA go further and only allow commercial use of the copyrighted work for individuals and worker-owned organizations.

(Fork of the CC-NC license)
